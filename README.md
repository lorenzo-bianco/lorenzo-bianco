## Hi, I’m Lorenzo 👋

I work as a Product Manager in a marketplace, so my day-to-day is all about experiments, A/B tests, AI Agents and automations that improve revenue and core product metrics.

What I work on:

• 🔍 Product analysis & experiments: funnel breakdowns, activation tests, paywall experiments, subscription mechanics to improve conversion, retention and ARPU.

• 🤖 AI Agents & automation: design and optimization of agents for content moderation, fraud checks, and qualification flows, mostly built end-to-end with n8n and ElevenLabs.

• 💰 Revenue optimization: checkout A/B tests, pricing framing, dynamic pricing systems to reduce freemium leakage and increase paid subscription retention.
